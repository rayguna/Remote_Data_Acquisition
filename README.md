# Remote Data Acquisition Using an Open-Source Distributed Control System
Connect your Sensors to the Network using EPICS in Your Next Electronics Project
***
<img src="arduino_and_esp32_sensor_systems.png">

Scope:
This repository houses Python, C++, and EPICS-related files that are used to connect multiple sensors to the local network via an open-source EPICS distributed control system. The sensors are interfaced to the network via Arduino Uno and ESP32-S3 microcontrollers. The Arduino Uno connects to the internet through ethernet communication, whereas ESP32-S3 connects to the internet through a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi communication.
